Description: The software implements a scalable, flexible, robust and powerful method for large-scale multiple testing (FDR and FWER control), exploiting the auxiliary covariates that are either informative of the statistical power (e.g., variance, sparsity, sample size, etc) or the prior null probability (SNP deleteriousness, association p values from a similar disease/phenotype).  It supports multiple covariates of different types (continuous or categorical) and allows the prior null probability and/or the shape parameter of the alternative distribution to depend on the covariates.
Depends: R (>= 3.2.0), ggplot2, cowplot, qvalue, matrixStats
